Name of Project: NBA Super Player Mashup

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

Users will be able to create a character that has the abilities of different NBA players (these will be adapted from the NBA 2k23 video game stats). They will choose which NBA players real life abilities to add to their character's different attributes. They will then be able to play with their super player in a 3d enviornment and see how their build looks and feels.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

-Inputs of at least 10 NBA players stats for users to mod their character's abilities with.
-Name input capabilities for the user's character.
-A character that reacts to the user's imputs.
-A basketball and court that function as close to life like versions.
-A way to dribble, run, jump, shoot, and dunk the ball.
-A way to track score of made baskets.
-A menu that allows the user to change stats, reset game, and pause.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I have never worked with Unity 3d and I am very excited to get to play around with it.
